I submitted my Module Challenge today 23/11/2023 at 01:20 pm.

The main part of the assignment is all my own work. I sought some help from ChatGPT from time to time. 

I sought help from ChatGPT to review possible answers to the three questions posed in the Report section of the report. 

I sought help from ChatGPT to prepare the table in the Bonus1 worksheet. In particular, I needed help with the COUNTIF() function to test the outcomes and the range of a pledged amount. I did it myself first but found I was getting wrong answers. I got some help from ChatGPT, and they sent me a modified code, which worked. I am learning the importance of getting all the punctuation right.
